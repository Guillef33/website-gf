            Hi, Iâ€™m Matt. Nice to meet you. Since beginning my journey as a
            freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I've done remote work for
            agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented
            people to create digital products for both business and consumer
            use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually
            working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
          </p>
        </div>
      </>
